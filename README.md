Project Description:
My project is an audio visualiser. In this project there are several sound effects and a song for the program to visualise. There are also several sliders and buttons that add different effects to the audio.

How to use this project:
Once you download your own version of the project, open visualiser.tscn, then you just use your mouse to press the buttons and adjust the sliders.

Features:
A colourful visualiser, that displays the audio from the song and different sound effects.
Buttons to play, pause and stop several sound effects and a song. There are also buttons to enable and disable different audio effects.
Sliders to raise and lower the volume, and to change two different audio effects.
